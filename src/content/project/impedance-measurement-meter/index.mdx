summary: As part of the 3rd year Instrumentation module, we created a complex impedance meter designed to measure devices with impedance of 10 to 1MOhm using stimulus frequency of 1 to 100kHz. The digital part of the device was based on the STM32 and the analog frontend was a custom PCB shield.

In my 3rd year, I took the instrumentation module. This module introduces electrical measurements in both theory and practice. For the coursework which was done in a group of 2, we created a complex impedance meter designed to measure devices (DUT) with impedance of 10 to 1MOhm using stimulus frequency of 1 to 100kHz.

The analog frontend was implemented on a custom 2 layer PCB shield. The frontend used a Auto-Balancing Bridge (ABB) as the backbone of the design. There was a multiplexer to select various reference resistors to closely match the impedance of the DUT and there were 2 instrumentation operational amplifiers to measure the voltages across the DUT and known reference resistor. 

The signal generator, Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) and Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) was implemented using an STM32 on a Nucleo 64 Development Board. The STM32 DMA was configured to read data from the ADC to a buffer in sync with the signal generated by the DAC. The voltages are passed into the Goertzel algorithm to measure the magnitude and phase. This implementation of the Digital Fourier Transformation (DFT) is quick when measuring just 1 frequency. These voltages and the known resistance is then used to find the impedance.

During the demonstration, my group was not able to make the multiplexer work because we possibly ran too much current through it due to a short. However, the entire experience of designing, simulating, designing, assembling and testing an electronic circuit was enlightening and I really enjoyed it.
